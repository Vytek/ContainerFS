Feature roadmap is broken into two sections: 1) things that won't break the existing file format, and 2) things that will.

Using existing format:
- recursive directory deletion

With revised format:
- Multi-user and locking - will require a separate lock node (or multiple) and assuredly other state data
- Naked data blocks - move the list/organization into metadata nodes so there is no overhead within a data 
  block and better efficiency/utilization in the metadata block
- Lock on write - for internal objects such as the bitarray for specifying which blocks are in use or free, 
  to prevent contention scenarios in multi-user write edge cases (i.e. two writers where the container is
  nearly full and both try to fill it)
